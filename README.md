# Quadcopter_Control
This Repository contains MATLAB files for the control of a delivery quadcopter that has been designed for autonomous delivery applications.

The ZIP file contains the control algorithm, in addition to a 3D simulation of the trajectory control of the quadcopter. The rest of the files are the raw control algorithms on simulink and MATLAB files.
